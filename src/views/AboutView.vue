    <h1>Purpose of this Web Site</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This web site provides an introduction to MoHSESâ„¢(Modular Healthcare Simulation and Education System), and serves as the primary entry point to information the team will be sharing with our community. In the next few months, as we ready drafts of the standards documents, we will create a link from this page to a document repository with tools for comments and feedback to commence a dialog leading up to the initial release of a comprehensive set of standards document that would allow any interested party to create a plug and play module that would use all resources provided by the development platform.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The terms: MoHSES; Modular Healthcare Simulation and Education SystemAdvanced; Modular Manikin; AMM; and AMM-Compatible will be Copyrighted and belong to the MoHSES project and platform. As part of the open-standards and open-source nature of the project, they are not intended to be used as a product name, but can be used by products that comply with the standards once published.</p>
